# Animal-Classification-Transfer-Learning
A CNN Classification model built on the pretrained VGG-16 model parameters. 

It is a basic notebook I wrote just to observe the practical aspects of the transfer learning concept.
By using fine tuning, data augmentation and some callbacks, I could improve the model.
Also, this notebook displays the ability of the VGG-16 model. We obtained pretty good results by only changing
the last dense layer and training it for 2 epochs.
